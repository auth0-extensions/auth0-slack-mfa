# Usage

1. `npm init`
2. `npm install express --save`
3. `npm install webtask-tools --save`
4. Create `index.js` with the minimal express extension:

  ```js
  var express = require('express');
  var Webtask = require('webtask-tools');

  var app = express();

  app.get('/', function (req, res) {
    res.status(200).send('Hello World');
  });

  module.exports = app;
  ```

## Authenticating the extension with Auth0

A useful extension would typically use the Auth0 API. We created a module that abstract away the OAuth2 consent flow with the Auth0 API.

1. `npm install auth0-oauth2-express --save`
2. Add the `auth0-oauth2-express` module and configure the scopes you want. This will ask the right consent to the user.

  ```js
  var auth0   = require('auth0-oauth2-express');

  app.use(auth0({
    scopes: 'read:connections'
  }));
  ```

## Running locally

To run the sample extension locally:

```bash
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

## What is Auth0?

Auth0 helps you to:

* Add authentication with [multiple authentication sources](https://docs.auth0.com/identityproviders), either social like **Google, Facebook, Microsoft Account, LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter, Box, Salesforce, amont others**, or enterprise identity systems like **Windows Azure AD, Google Apps, Active Directory, ADFS or any SAML Identity Provider**.
* Add authentication through more traditional **[username/password databases](https://docs.auth0.com/mysql-connection-tutorial)**.
* Add support for **[linking different user accounts](https://docs.auth0.com/link-accounts)** with the same user.
* Support for generating signed [Json Web Tokens](https://docs.auth0.com/jwt) to call your APIs and **flow the user identity** securely.
* Analytics of how, when and where users are logging in.
* Pull data from other sources and add it to the user profile, through [JavaScript rules](https://docs.auth0.com/rules).
